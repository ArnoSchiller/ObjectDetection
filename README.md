## ObjectDetection by Schiller 
This Repository is used to train and process object detection.

To train models from the tensorflow object detection API the tensorflow/models repository is cloned from https://github.com/tensorflow/models.
Also the the repository from the yolov5 is used to train yolov5 models (https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5).

To evaluate models the Object-Detection-Metrics repository is cloned and adapted (https://github.com/rafaelpadilla/Object-Detection-Metrics/).
